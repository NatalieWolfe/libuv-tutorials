# libuv-tutorials
A set of tutorials for teaching myself libuv.

This is just a handful of simple projects useful for learning libuv, and as reference later on. For
a much more comprehensive introduction to libuv I recommend Nikhil Marathe's _An Introduction to
libuv_, available online here: http://nikhilm.github.io/uvbook/

## Set Up
Run `./setup.sh` to assemble all of the dependencies for these tutorials, or you can set it up
yourself using Gyp. The set up script will install Gyp if it isn't already.

This project has the following dependencies:
 - [gyp](https://code.google.com/p/gyp/)
 - [libuv](https://github.com/libuv/libuv)
 - python 2.7 (for gyp)
